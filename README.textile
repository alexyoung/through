h2. Overview

Through is a small geolocation web API.  You can use it to:

* Look up the location of an IP address
* Find out the time zone for a location
* Get responses in JSON
* Centralise your geographical data so each of your apps don't need to store it

I didn't want to reproduce the same functionality across my web apps, so I thought an API would be a good solution.

h2. Installation

# Install libgeoip (sudo port install libgeoip)
